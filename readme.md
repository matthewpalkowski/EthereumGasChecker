# Ethereum Gas Checker

Application designed to monitor Ethereum gas prices as reported by https://etherscan.io/. User can
set a threshold for Ethereum gas prices at which they wish to be notified so the user can take 
whatever action they may want with their mining setup.

## System requirements

target device (download link at https://www.java.com/en/download/).

## Intallation

a copy of Java Runtime Environment, use download link above.
